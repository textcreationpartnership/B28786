            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

               <hi>REASONS Humbly Offered to the Honourable the House of Commons, AGAINST</hi> Buying any Foreign Bottoms into <hi>ENGLAND</hi> for the future, or for laying such a Tax on them as may be greater than free Ships of this Kingdom pay.</head>
            <p>FIrst, It has Caused since the said Act a visible decay of Building Ships; as for instance, In <hi>Ipswich</hi> where many Ships used to be Built for the Coal-Trade, there hath not been one Built these Three years; and at <hi>Alborough, Dunwich, Walderswick, Woodbridge</hi> and <hi>Harwich,</hi> many Ships have belonged to the Coal-Trade and now there is not in all these places above One Ship, a small Pink and a <hi>Dutch</hi> Buss or two excepted.</p>
            <p>And whereas the places above mention'd, before the Act commenc'd, Built yearly stout good Ships, fit upon occasion to serve His Majesty in time of War, now so oft as they are lost or worn out, we are supply'd from <hi>Holland</hi> and other parts beyond the Seas, with slight Vessels built with Firr, which enjoys the same Priviledge in this Trade as the <hi>English</hi> Ships do, because the Trade is not able to bear the Charge of better Vessels; and besides the decay of good Ships and loss of Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, great numbers of our Builders and Shipwrights; <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are discouraged and are not able to maintain themselves and breed servants in these Trades as formerly they used to do.</p>
            <p>But it has been Objected by some, <hi>That the Building many Ships at home will waste our</hi> English <hi>Plank and may be a Prejudice to His Majesty in preventing the supply of Stores for the</hi> Navy Royal. To this we Answer;</p>
            <p>That we are as well able as the <hi>Hollanders</hi> to build all such ships for the Coal-Trade with Forreign Plank, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> so that the Plank, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of our own growth cannot be Exhausted.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>This will have these following good Effects.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We shall imploy our own Ships in fetching not only Plank but Pitch, Tarr, Hemp, Masts, Canvas, Iron, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port our own Commodities for Payment, which will bring a Revenue to His Majesty, both outward and inward, if an Act were to Prohibit the buying and forreign Bottoms into <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> or such a Duty laid on those that should Buy, as would Discourage such Buyer, and Encourage Building stout Ships at home; many hundreds depending on Shipping, will find employment at home, by which means Building and Naviga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion will flourish, the money expended therein laid out with our Neighbours, would circulate among us, and no body could be Prejudiced by it, but Forreigners, who eat the Breat out of our <hi>Englishmens</hi> mouths, in whose hands the Building Trade now lyeth.</p>
